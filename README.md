# Lecture 08-2 ACCESSING MEMORY IN MIPS

This is a folder containing the lecture materials for Wednesday, April 1st's on-line lecture. It includes  
• PDF of my lecture slides (which might change by noon) `slides.pdf`   
• the material covered by lecture as notes (which will change by noon) `NOTES.md`   
• some sample MIPS assembly source code in `samples`  
I'll email you an invitation to the Zoom lecture which will be held at 3-4pm.

We cover load/store operations more deeply, looking at using
offsets. We study array and linked list code but written in MIPS
assembly.

I'm also assigning Homework 08 today. This is due next Wednesday, 4/8,
at 3pm. Go to the syllabus page to find it.
